# DEPICT (DEcoder for PrIncipled semantiC segmenTation)
This repository is the official Pytorch implementation of paper [Rethinking Decoders for Transformer-based Semantic Segmentation: Compression is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03033) by Qishuai Wen and Chun-Guang Li, NeurIPS2024.
## Models
We release our models trained on the ADE20K dataset, including variants of [DEPICT-SA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1feq6ldmup86Qdav7GVX9rYWQqufiHtSJ?usp=drive_link) and [DEPICT-CA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zaz43QPTcHnYVlPGlZUXfTruag93wBG7?usp=drive_link).
## Acknowledgements
Our work and code are inspired by and built upon [CRATE](https://github.com/Ma-Lab-Berkeley/CRATE) (Strudel et al., 2021) and [Segmenter](https://github.com/rstrudel/segmenter) (Yu et al., 2023).
